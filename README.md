Roulette is a classic game of chance found in casinos and other gambling venues all across
the world. Given its multitude of variables in regards to player input, along with potential for
high stakes, it is no wonder there has been much study on the game by statisticians and the
like. In our case we seek to create a program using MATLAB to simulate a game of roulette,
either by playing with the same bet one thousand times and seeing the profit or until a player
goes bankrupt. This is done by having our main function ask for player input on how they
would want to play, ask what types of bets they wish to place, and the output will give the
win percentage, how much “profit” was potentially made, how many rounds they lasted, and
gives a graph as a visual for the win-loss ratio. 

## Instructions to Run
